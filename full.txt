## RECENT FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS

### **🔧 Nearby Places Functionality Fixes**

**Issues Identified & Fixed:**
1. **Incorrect Overpass API Query Syntax** - Fixed malformed tag queries
2. **Limited Place Categories** - Expanded from 9 to 9 better categories with multiple tags each
3. **Complex Tag Syntax Errors** - Simplified and corrected tag parsing
4. **API Reliability Issues** - Added parallel processing and better error handling
5. **Poor Fallback System** - Improved mock data generation

**Technical Improvements:**
- **Parallel API Calls**: All category queries now run simultaneously instead of sequentially
- **Better Error Handling**: Individual category failures don't break the entire search
- **Improved Timeouts**: Reduced from 30s to 15s per query with 25s Overpass timeout
- **Enhanced Place Names**: Better name generation from OSM tags
- **Improved Address Parsing**: Better address construction from OSM address components
- **More Realistic Mock Data**: Updated mock data to match new categories

**New Category Structure:**
- Each category now supports multiple OSM tags for better coverage
- More common place types (gas stations, shopping, healthcare, banks)
- Better organized transportation category combining multiple transport types
- Entertainment category for leisure activities

**Performance Enhancements:**
- Reduced places per category from 10 to 8 for faster loading
- Better rating generation (3.5-5.0 instead of 3.0-5.0)
- Improved distance calculations and filtering
- More efficient data processing

### **🧭 Navigation & Directions Improvements**

**Real Route Calculation:**
- **Primary**: OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for real turn-by-turn directions
- **Secondary**: OpenRouteService API for detailed route instructions

- **Duration Per Step**: Individual timing for each route segment
- **Travel Mode Optimization**: Different routing profiles for driving/cycling/walking
- **Directional Instructions**: Cardinal direction-based guidance (north, southeast, etc.)
- **Route Source Indicator**: Shows which routing service provided the directions

**Technical Improvements:**
- Async route calculation with proper loading states
- Real-time route recalculation when travel mode changes
- Enhanced error handling for routing API failures
